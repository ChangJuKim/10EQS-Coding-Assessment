Given my cusory glance at the data, I have discovered that the data is extremely inconsistent.

For instance:
1. The "Yerba Mate Loose Leaf (1lb)" product has a dollar sign before the price, whereas no other items have that value.
2. The restock threshold for "Matcha Green Tea Powder (4oz)" does not have a restock threshold. If it is not to be restocked, perhaps it should have an effectively infinite number.
3. The category is inconsistent with its capitalization.
4. I would suggest putting a 0 for the stock of "Mint Tea (25 bags)" instead of "out of stock".
5. The date is consistent, particularly with "Hot Chocolate Mix (1lb)". It is in a MM/DD/YYYY format instead of a YYYY-MM-DD format.

These are my findings of the sample data. I would like to highlight that due to lack of time, I found these discrepancies by looking at the data.
