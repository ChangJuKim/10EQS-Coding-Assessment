## Instructions

Note that my code simply prints out the csv file, and does not do anything else due to lack of time.
Given that I spent an hour in creating this github and printing the csv files, I decided not to continue coding and instead wrote out my manual analysis.

1. Download the github repository.
2. In a terminal, go to the root directory of the folder you have downloaded.
3. Enter "javac src/\*.java" (without quotes)
4. Enter "java src/analysis default" (without quotes). You can also enter "java src/analysis" and attempt to provide a different file.

## Required API Keys/Credentials

None

## Approach

I started with reading the given file. Then I ran out of time, so I decided to manually parse through the csv file and provide my insights.

## Issues or limitations

1. The provided CSV data was cut off. I inferenced the headers of the last two categories.
2. There was no language specified, and since I am rusty with Python and JavaScript, I decided to code my solution in Java given the time restraint.
3. The one hour time limit seems arbitrary as a candidate can modify their github past the deadline.
